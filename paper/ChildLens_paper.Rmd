# Dataset Overview

#### Activity Classes
The ChildLens dataset contains a total of 14 activity and 5 location classes. The activities are based on the actions of the child in the video and can be divided into _person-only_ activities, such as "child talking" or "other person talking, and _person-object_ activities, such as "drawing" or "playing with object". You can find the complete list of activity classes with a brief description in the appendix. The activities can be further divided into _audio-based_, _visual-based_, and _multimodal_ activities, as presented in figure \@ref(fig:activity-classes). The following list provides an overview of the different activity types:

- **Audio-based activities**: _child talking_, _other person talking_, _overheard speech_, _singing / humming_, _listening to music / audiobook_
- **Visual-based activities**: _watching something_, _drawing_, _crafting things_, _dancing_
- **Multimodal activities**: _playing with object_, _playing without object_, _pretend play_, _reading book_, _making music_

The location classes describe the current location of the child in the video and include _livingroom_, _playroom_, _bathroom_, _hallway_, and _other_.

#### Statistics

```{r video-statistics, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Video recording duration (in minutes) per child ID."}
data <- read_csv2("quantex_share_data_sheet.csv")

unique_data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Minutes_per_ID), Minutes_per_ID != 0, 
         !is.na(ID), Labeled == "yes") %>%
  distinct(ID, Minutes_per_ID, .keep_all = TRUE)

filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(Date), Labeled == "yes") %>%
  mutate(Date = as.Date(Date, format = "%d.%m.%Y")) 

min_minutes <- min(unique_data$Minutes_per_ID[unique_data$Minutes_per_ID > 0], na.rm = TRUE)
max_minutes <- max(unique_data$Minutes_per_ID, na.rm = TRUE)
sum_minutes <- sum(unique_data$Minutes_per_ID, na.rm = TRUE)
sum_hours <- sum_minutes/60
nr_children <- nrow(unique_data)

oldest_date <- min(filtered_data$Date)
youngest_date <- max(filtered_data$Date)

oldest_year <- as.numeric(format(oldest_date, "%Y"))
oldest_month <- as.numeric(format(oldest_date, "%m"))
youngest_year <- as.numeric(format(youngest_date, "%Y"))
youngest_month <- as.numeric(format(youngest_date, "%m"))

# Calculate the interval between the two dates
time_span_months <- (youngest_year - oldest_year) * 12 + (youngest_month - oldest_month)+1
```

The ChildLens dataset comprises `r sum_hours` hours of video material recorded by `r nr_children` children aged 3 to 5 years. For each child, the duration of recorded video material varies between `r min_minutes` and `r max_minutes` minutes. A detailed distribution of the video duration per child can be found in figure \@ref(fig:minutes-per-child). This diverse dataset also includes a varying number of clips for each of the 14 activity classes, ranging from **x** to **x** clips per class. The clip duration depends on the activity; for example, audio-related actions like "child talking" may only last a few seconds, while activities like "reading a book" may last several minutes. As shown in table \@ref(tab:train-val-test), the total number of **xx** clips is divided into **xx** training clips, **xx** validation clips, and **xx** testing clips for each class.


```{r minutes-per-child, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap="Video recording duration (in minutes) per child ID."}
unique_data$ID <- as.factor(unique_data$ID)

ggplot(unique_data, aes(x = Minutes_per_ID)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(n = 10), labels = scales::label_number(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Minutes per ID", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
```


```{r train-val-test, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis', eval=FALSE}
my.data <- "training | validation | testing
            10        | 10           | 10"
df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data), header=FALSE, sep="|", strip.white=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
# Set the first row as column names
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,]))
# Remove the first row (which is now used as column names)
df <- df[-1,] 
row.names(df) <- NULL
# Create the table using apa_table function
apa_table(
  df,
  caption = "Number of clips per class",
  escape = TRUE,
)
```

#### Exhaustive multi-label annotations
The dataset provides detailed annotations for each video file. These annotations specify the child’s current location within the video, the start and end times of each activity, the activity class, and whether the child is engaged alone or with somebody else. For every person involved in the activity, we capture age and gender. If multiple activities occur simultaneously in a video, each activity is individually labeled and extracted as a separate clip. For example, if a segment shows a child “reading a book” while also “talking,” two separate clips are created: one for “reading a book” and another for “child talking.” This exhaustive labeling strategy ensures that each activity is accurately represented in the dataset. 

# Dataset Generation
This section outlines the steps taken to create the ChildLens dataset. We provide detailed information on the video collection process, the labeling strategy employed, and the generation of activity labels.

## Step 1: Collection of Egocentric Videos
The ChildLens dataset consists of egocentric videos recorded by children aged 3 to 5 years. A total of `r nr_children` children from families living in a mid-sized city in Germany, participated in the study. The videos were captured at home using a camera embedded in a vest worn by the children, which can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:camera-worn). This setup allowed the children to move freely throughout their homes while recording their activities. The camera, a _PatrolEyes WiFi HD Infrared Police Body Camera_, was equipped with a 140-degree wide-angle lens and captured everything within the child's field of view with a resolution of 1920x1080p at 30 fps. The camera also recorded audio, allowing us to capture the child's speech and other sounds in the environment. Additionally, the parents were handed a small checklist of activities to record, ensuring that a variety of activities were captured in the videos. The focus was on capturing everyday activities that children typically engage in. Parents were therefore asked to include the following activities in the recordings:

- Child is invited to read a book together with an adult
- Child is invited to play with toys alone
- Child is invited to play with toys with someone else (adult or child)
- Child is invited to draw/craft something

The videos were recorded over a period of `r time_span_months` months, resulting in a total of `r sum_hours` hours of video footage.

```{r camera-worn, dpi=500, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Vest with the embedded camera worn by the children"}
knitr::include_graphics("camera_worn.png")
```

## Step 2: Creation of Labeling Strategy
To create a comprehensive labeling strategy for the ChildLens dataset, we first defined a list of activities that children typically engage in. This list was based on previous research on child development and the activities that children are known to participate in. We then developed a detailed catalog of activities that were likely to be captured in the videos and chose to make the activity classes more granular by distinguishing between activities like "making music" and "singing/humming" or "drawing" and "crafting things". After an initial review of the videos, we decided to add another class "overheard speech" to capture situations in which the child is not directly involved in a conversation but can hear it. We also added "pretend play" as a separate class to capture situations in which the child is engaged in imaginative play. This approach allowed us to capture the diversity of activities that children engage in and create a comprehensive dataset for activity analysis.

```{r superannotate, dpi=600, fig.align='center', fig.cap="SuperAnnotate platform utilized for video annotation"}
knitr::include_graphics("SuperAnnotate.png")
```

## Step 3: Manual Labeling Process
Before the actual annotation process, a setup meeting was held to introduce the annotators to the labeling strategy. To familiarize themselves with the task, the annotators were assigned 25 sample videos to practice and gain hands-on experience. These initial annotations were reviewed by us, and feedback was provided to refine their approach. A total of three feedback loops were conducted to ensurethat the annotators follow the labeling strategy properly.

The videos were manually annotated by native German speakers who watched each video and labeled the activities present in the footage. The annotators marked the start and end points of each activity, ensuring that the annotations were accurate and detailed. The labeling process was conducted using the SuperAnnotate platform, which allowed for efficient annotation and review of the videos. Figure \@ref(fig:superannotate) provides a screenshot of the SuperAnnotate platform used for video annotation. To ensure the quality of the annotations the following steps were taken:

1. **Initial round of annotations**: Each set of videos is assigned to specific annotators, who handle the annotations, make changes, and apply corrections as needed. In total, three annotators were actively working on the annotation process.
2. **Quality assurance**: One person is dedicated to quality assurance, ensuring that the annotations are accurate and consistent across all videos.
3. **Review process**: After the initial annotations are completed, the annotations are reviewed by the internal team to ensure that they are accurate and complete. Any discrepancies or errors are corrected before the final submission.

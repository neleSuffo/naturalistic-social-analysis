# Dataset Overview

#### Activity Classes
The ChildLens dataset contains a total of 14 activity and 5 location classes. The activities are based on the activities of the child in the video and can be divided into _person-only_ activities, such as "child talking" or "other person talking", and _person-object_ activities, such as "drawing" or "playing with object". You can find a brief description of each class in the appendix. The activities can be further divided into _audio-based_, _visual-based_, and _multimodal_ activities, as presented in figure \@ref(fig:activity-classes). The following list provides an overview of the different activity types:

- **Audio-based activities**: _child talking_, _other person talking_, _overheard speech_, _singing / humming_, _listening to music / audiobook_
- **Visual-based activities**: _watching something_, _drawing_, _crafting things_, _dancing_
- **Multimodal activities**: _playing with object_, _playing without object_, _pretend play_, _reading book_, _making music_

For every activity, the dataset includes information on the start and end times of the activity, the activity class, and whether the child is engaged alone or with somebody else. For every external person involved in the activity, we capture age and gender. The location classes describe the current location of the child in the video and include _livingroom_, _playroom_, _bathroom_, _hallway_, and _other_.

The ChildLens dataset comprises of `r sum_videos` video files with a total of `r sum_hours` hours recorded by `r nr_children` children aged 3 to 5 years (M=`r mean_age`, SD=`r sd_age`). It includes `r count_3_plus` videos from children aged 3, `r count_4_plus` videos from children aged 4, and `r count_5_plus` videos from children aged 5. The duration of recorded video material per child varies between `r min_minutes` and `r max_minutes` minutes (M=`r mean_minutes`, SD=`r sd_minutes`). A detailed distribution of the video duration per child can be found in figure \@ref(fig:minutes-per-child). 

```{r audio-classes-statistics, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis', eval=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(
  `Audio-based Activity Class` = c("Child talking", "Other person talking", "Overheard Speech", "Singing/Humming", "Listening to music/audiobook"),
  `Instance Count` = c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100),
  `Total Duration` = c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
colnames(df) <- c("Audio-based Activity Class", "Instance Count", "Total Duration (min)")

df %>%
  kable("pipe", caption = "Summary of Audio-Based Activity Classes") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE)
```

This diverse dataset includes a varying number of instances across the 14 activity classes, ranging from **x** to **x** instances per class. Overlapping instances are counted separately for each activity class; if two activities occur simultaneously in a given video segment, both classes will receive a count for that segment. As a result, parts of the video may be counted multiple times, once for each activity class. The duration of each instance varies by activity. For example, audio-based activities like "child talking" may last only a few seconds, while activities like "reading a book" can span several minutes. As this paper only focuses on the audio-based and video-based activity classes, tables \@ref(tab:audio-classes-statistics) and \@ref(tab:video-classes-statistics) provide the total number of instances and the total duration of all instances for the respective activity classes. The full table with all activity classes is available in the appendix.

#### Exhaustive multi-label annotations
The dataset provides detailed annotations for each video file. These annotations specify the child’s current location within the video, the start and end times of each activity, the activity class, and whether the child is engaged alone or with somebody else. For every person involved in the activity, we capture age and gender. If multiple activities occur simultaneously in a video, each activity is individually labeled and extracted as a separate clip. For example, if a segment shows a child “reading a book” while also “talking,” two separate clips are created: one for “reading a book” and another for “child talking.” This exhaustive labeling strategy ensures that each activity is accurately represented in the dataset. 

# Dataset Generation
This section outlines the steps taken to create the ChildLens dataset. We provide detailed information on the video collection process, the labeling strategy employed, and the generation of activity labels.

## Step 1: Collection of Egocentric Videos
The ChildLens dataset consists of egocentric videos recorded by children aged 3 to 5 years over a period of `r time_span_months` months. A total of `r nr_children` children from families living in a mid-sized city in Germany, participated in the study. The videos were captured at home using a camera embedded in a vest worn by the children, which can be seen in figure \@ref(fig:camera-worn). This setup allowed the children to move freely throughout their homes while recording their activities. The camera, a _PatrolEyes WiFi HD Infrared Police Body Camera_, was equipped with a 140-degree wide-angle lens and captured everything within the child's field of view with a resolution of 1920x1080p at 30 fps. The camera also recorded audio, allowing us to capture the child's speech and other sounds in the environment. Additionally, the parents were handed a small checklist of activities to record, ensuring that a variety of activities were captured in the videos. The focus was on capturing everyday activities that children typically engage in. Parents were therefore asked to include the following elements in the recordings:

- Child spends time in different rooms and performs various activities in each room
- Child is invited to read a book together with an adult
- Child is invited to play with toys alone
- Child is invited to play with toys with someone else (adult or child)
- Child is invited to draw/craft something

```{r camera-worn, dpi=500, fig.align='center', fig.cap="Vest with the embedded camera worn by the children"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/camera_worn.png")
```

## Step 2: Creation of Labeling Strategy
To create a comprehensive labeling strategy for the ChildLens dataset, we first defined a list of activities that children typically engage in. This list was based on previous research on child development and the activities that children are known to participate in. We then developed a detailed catalog of activities that were likely to be captured in the videos and chose to make the activity classes more granular by distinguishing between activities like "making music" and "singing/humming" or "drawing" and "crafting things". 

After an initial review of the videos, we decided to add another class "overheard speech" to capture situations in which the child is not directly involved in a conversation but can hear it. We also added "pretend play" as a separate class to capture situations in which the child is engaged in imaginative play. This approach allowed us to capture the diversity of activities that children engage in and create a comprehensive dataset for activity analysis.

```{r superannotate, dpi=600, fig.align='center', fig.cap="SuperAnnotate platform utilized for video annotation"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/SuperAnnotate.png")
```

## Step 3: Manual Labeling Process
Before the actual annotation process, a setup meeting was held to introduce the annotators to the labeling strategy. To familiarize themselves with the task, the annotators were assigned 25 sample videos to practice and gain hands-on experience. These initial annotations were reviewed by the research team, and feedback was provided to refine the approach. A total of three feedback loops were conducted to ensure that the annotators follow the labeling strategy properly.

The videos were manually annotated by native German speakers who watched each video and labeled the activities present in the footage. Annotators marked the start and end points of each activity to ensure accuracy and detail. For audio annotations, we implemented a 2-second rule for the categories “other person talking” and “child talking”: if the break between two utterances was 2 seconds or less, it was considered a single event; breaks longer than 2 seconds split the activity into separate instances. The annotations were conducted using the SuperAnnotate platform, allowing for efficient annotation and review of the videos. Figure @ref(fig:superannotate) provides a screenshot of the SuperAnnotate platform used for video annotation. To ensure the quality of the annotations, the following steps were taken:

1. **Initial round of annotations**: Each set of videos is assigned to specific annotators, who handle the annotations, make changes, and apply corrections as needed. In total, three annotators were actively working on the annotation process.
2. **Quality assurance**: One person is dedicated to quality assurance, ensuring that the annotations are accurate and consistent across all videos.
3. **Review process**: After the initial annotations are completed, the annotations are reviewed by the internal team to ensure that they are accurate and complete. Any discrepancies or errors are corrected before the final submission.

# Benchmark Performance
In this chapter, we present the results of applying two model architectures to the ChildLens dataset. While the dataset supports multimodal activity analysis, we focus on two specific tasks: temporal activity localization using video data and voice type classification using audio data. For temporal activity localization, we use the Boundary-Matching Network (BMN) model, a state-of-the-art approach in this domain, and train it from scratch on the unique activity classes in the ChildLens video data. For voice type classification, we apply the Voice Type Classifier (VTC) [@lavechinOpensourceVoiceType2020], also state-of-the-art, which was trained on similar data. Both models provide initial results and establish a benchmark for future research.

#A short architecture overview of the models is presented in figure \@ref(fig:bmn-architecture) and figure \@ref(fig:vtc-architecture).
```

```{r vtc-architecture, dpi=600, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE, fig.cap="Voice Type Classifier architecture applied to ChildLens audio data"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/VTC_architecture.png")
```

## Boundary-Matching Network 
We utilize the Boundary-Matching Network model [@linBMNBoundaryMatchingNetwork2019] for temporal activity localization.

### Implementation Details
- details on training
- optimization strategy
- video prepocessing etc

### Evaluation
The most relevant findings of the BMN evaluation are summarized in the following sections.

- Class accuracy differences
  - full list of classification accuracy can be bound in figure **xx**
  - classes **xx** and **xx** are hardest to classify, because of **xx**
  - **xx** classes were easier to classify than others such as **xx** and **xx** because of **xx**

- Class confusion
  - describe which classes are often confused with each other (e.g. **xx** and **xx**)
  
## Voice Type Classifier
The Voice Type Classifier [@lavechinOpensourceVoiceType2020] is a state-of-the-art model designed to classify audio rawfiles into five distinct voice types: _key child_, _other child_, _male speech_, _female speech_, and _speech._ Its architecture processes audio by first dividing it into 2-second chunks, which are passed through a SincNet to extract low-level features. These features are then fed into a stack of two bi-directional LSTMs, followed by three feed-forward layers. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function to produce a score between 0 and 1 for each class. The VTC is trained on 260 hours of audio material obtained from different child-centered audio datasets. Model valuation is performed by utilizing the \( F_1 \)-measure, which combines precision and recall using the following formula: 
\[
F_1 = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
\]
where \(\text{precision} = \frac{\text{tp}}{\text{tp} + \text{fp}}\) and  \(\text{recall} = \frac{\text{tp}}{\text{tp} + \text{fn}}\) with

- \(\text{tp}\) being the number of true positives,
- \(\text{fp}\) being the number of false positives, and
- \(\text{fn}\) being the number of false negatives.

The \( F_1 \) is a metric that combines precision and recall into a single value, calculated as their harmonic mean. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 representing perfect precision and recall, and 0 indicating no correct prediction The interpretation of the \( F_1 \) score depends on the specific application of the model. Generally, an \( F_1 \) score above 0.8 is considered good, while values above 0.9 are considered excellent. In some cases, a score around 0.5 can still be deemed acceptable, depending on the balance between precision and recall.. The \( F_1 \) score is computed for each class and averaged to provide an overall measure. No collar is applied to the evaluation, meaning that the prediction have to be exact to be considered correct. The model achieves an \( F_1 \)  score of 57.3, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art LENA model by 10.6 points.

```
### Data Preparation
Before applying the VTC to the ChildLens dataset, we mapped our audio-based activity classes to the VTC output classes to enable performance comparison. The following mapping strategy was applied:

- Child talking → **`Key Child`**
- Singing/Humming → **`Key Child`**
- Other person talking:
  - If `age = "Child"` → **`Other Child`**
  - If `age = "Adult"` & `gender = "Female"` → **`Female Speech`**
  - If `age = "Adult"` & `gender = "Male"` → **`Male Speech`**
- Overheard Speech → **`Speech`**

The activity class "Listening to music/audiobook" was not mapped to any VTC class, as it is not covered by the VTC model. The mapping process resulted in new numbers for the total durations for each VTC class, as shown in Table @ref(tab:vtc-classes-statistics).”

```{r vtc-classes-statistics, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis', eval=TRUE}
my.data <- "       | KCHI | CHI  | MAL   | FEM  | SPEECH 
            Total Duration (min)  | 100 | 100 | 100  | 100 | 100"
df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data), header=FALSE, sep="|", strip.white=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,]))
df <- df[-1,] 
row.names(df) <- NULL
apa_table(
  df,
  caption = "Total Duration (in minutes) of all Instances for each VTC Class",
  escape = TRUE,
)

The most relevant findings of the VTC evaluation are summarized in the following sections.
- summarize most crucial findings

```{r vtc-results, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis', eval=TRUE}
my.data <- "Dataset       | KCHI | CHI  | MAL   | FEM  | SPEECH | AVG
            ACLEW-Random  | 68.7 | 33.2 | 42.9  | 63.4 | 78.4   | 57.3
            ChildLens     | 59.1 | 79.2 | 17.8  | 33.4 | 68.3   | 51.5"
df <- read.delim(textConnection(my.data), header=FALSE, sep="|", strip.white=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,]))
df <- df[-1,] 
row.names(df) <- NULL
apa_table(
  df,
  caption = "Comparison of VTC performance on the ACLEW-Random dataset (used for model evaluation) and the ChildLens dataset, highlighting the F1  measure for each class and the average F1 score",
  escape = TRUE,
)
```

- which class performs worst - maybe why?
- which is best?
- how is the average compared to the ACLEW-Random dataset

## Dataset Bias
Overall, the dataset demographics are balanced. From the `r nr_children` children who participated in the study, `r female_count` children are female and `r male_count` are male. 


- is there gender bias in the dataset itself (how many female how many male)
- is ther gender bias in some categories (e.g. more female for drawing etc.)

## General Discussion

# Conclusion
In this paper, we introduced the ChildLens dataset, a novel egocentric video dataset designed for activity analysis in children. The dataset contains a wide range of children’s daily live activities, captured in naturalistic environments. We outlined the data collection process and the generation of activity labels, providing detailed information on the labeling strategy employed. Initial results of applying two state-of-the-art models to the dataset were presented, establishing a benchmark for future research. While our current analysis treats audio and video independently, future studies could leverage multimodal approaches to gain deeper insights into children’s behavior and activity patterns, advancing the understanding of developmental and interactional contexts.

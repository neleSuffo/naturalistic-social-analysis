  abstract = {Given a user wearing a low frame rate wearable camera during a day, this work aims to automatically detect the moments when the user gets engaged into a social interaction solely by reviewing the automatically captured photos by the worn camera. The proposed method, inspired by the sociological concept of F-formation, exploits distance and orientation of the appearing individuals -with respect to the user- in the scene from a bird-view perspective. As a result, the interaction pattern over the sequence can be understood as a two-dimensional time series that corresponds to the temporal evolution of the distance and orientation features over time. A Long-Short Term Memory-based Recurrent Neural Network is then trained to classify each time series. Experimental evaluation over a dataset of 30.000 images has shown promising results on the proposed method for social interaction detection in egocentric photo-streams.},

  abstract = {Several studies have investigated human interaction using modern tracking techniques for face-to-face encounters across various settings and age groups. However, little attention has been given to understanding how individual characteristics relate to social behavior. This is particularly important in younger age groups due to its potential effects on early childhood development. In this study, conducted during the Complexity 72h Workshop, we analyze human social interactions in a French preschool, where children's face-to-face interactions were monitored using proximity sensors over an academic year. We use metadata from parent surveys and preschool linguistic tests, covering demographic information and home habits, to examine the interplay between individual characteristics and contact patterns. Using a mixture of approaches, from random forest classifiers to network-based metrics at both dyadic and higher-order (group) levels, we identify sex, age, language scores, and number of siblings as the variables displaying the most significant associations with interaction patterns. We explore these variables' relationships to interactions within and outside classrooms and across mixed and single-grade classes. At the group level, we investigate how group affinity affects group persistence. We also find that higher-order network centrality (hypercoreness) is higher among children with siblings, indicating different group embedding despite similar total contact duration. This study aligns with existing literature on early social development and highlights the importance of integrating individual traits into the study of human interactions. Focusing on 2-5-year-olds offers insights into emerging social preferences during critical phases of cognitive development. Future research could use these findings to enhance mechanistic models of complex social systems by incorporating individual traits.},

  abstract = {Language is a universal human ability, acquired readily by young children, who otherwise struggle with many basics of survival. And yet, language ability is variable across individuals. Naturalistic and experimental observations suggest that children’s linguistic skills vary with factors like socioeconomic status and children’s gender. But which factors really influence children’s day-to-day language use? Here, we leverage speech technology in a big-data approach to report on a unique cross-cultural and diverse data set: {$>$}2,500 d-long, child-centered audio-recordings of 1,001 2- to 48-mo-olds from 12 countries spanning six continents across urban, farmer-forager, and subsistence-farming contexts. As expected, age and language-relevant clinical risks and diagnoses predicted how much speech (and speech-like vocalization) children produced. Critically, so too did adult talk in children’s environments: Children who heard more talk from adults produced more speech. In contrast to previous conclusions based on more limited sampling methods and a different set of language proxies, socioeconomic status (operationalized as maternal education) was not significantly associated with children’s productions over the first 4 y of life, and neither were gender or multilingualism. These findings from large-scale naturalistic data advance our understanding of which factors are robust predictors of variability in the speech behaviors of young learners in a wide range of everyday contexts.},

  abstract = {Realtime multi-person 2D pose estimation is a key component in enabling machines to have an understanding of people in images and videos. In this work, we present a realtime approach to detect the 2D pose of multiple people in an image. The proposed method uses a nonparametric representation, which we refer to as Part Affinity Fields (PAFs), to learn to associate body parts with individuals in the image. This bottom-up system achieves high accuracy and realtime performance, regardless of the number of people in the image. In previous work, PAFs and body part location estimation were refined simultaneously across training stages. We demonstrate that a PAF-only refinement rather than both PAF and body part location refinement results in a substantial increase in both runtime performance and accuracy. We also present the first combined body and foot keypoint detector, based on an internal annotated foot dataset that we have publicly released. We show that the combined detector not only reduces the inference time compared to running them sequentially, but also maintains the accuracy of each component individually. This work has culminated in the release of OpenPose, the first open-source realtime system for multi-person 2D pose detection, including body, foot, hand, and facial keypoints.},

This paper re-evaluates state-of-the-art architectures in light of the new Kinetics Human Action Video dataset. Kinetics has two orders of magnitude more data, with 400 human action classes and over 400 clips per class, and is collected from realistic, challenging YouTube videos. We provide an analysis on how current architectures fare on the task of action classification on this dataset and how much performance improves on the smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on Kinetics. We also introduce a new Two-Stream Inflated 3D ConvNet (I3D) that is based on 2D ConvNet inflation: filters and pooling kernels of very deep image classification ConvNets are expanded into 3D, making it possible to learn seamless spatio-temporal feature extractors from video while leveraging successful ImageNet architecture designs and even their parameters. We show that, after pre-training on Kinetics, I3D models considerably improve upon the state-of-the-art in action classification, reaching 80.9\% on HMDB-51 and 98.0\% on UCF-101.},

Data was collected monthly with one week-long deployments. In parallel, survey campaigns were carried out to record the socio-demographic and language background of children and their families, and to monitor the linguistic skills of the pupils at regular intervals. From data we inferred real social interactions and distinguished inter- and intra-class interactions in different settings. We share ten weeks of cleaned, pre-processed and reconstructed interaction data recorded over a complete school year, together with two sets of survey data providing details about the pupils’ socio-demographic profile and language development level at the beginning and end of this period.

  abstract = {Recently, Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has attracted rising attention, and accordingly, remarkable progresses have been achieved. However, the existing methods tend to use various basic models (e.g, detector and embedding model), and different training or inference tricks, etc. As a result, the construction of a good baseline for a fair comparison is essential. In this paper, a classic tracker, i.e., DeepSORT, is first revisited, and then is significantly improved from multiple perspectives such as object detection, feature embedding, and trajectory association. The proposed tracker, named StrongSORT, contributes a strong and fair baseline for the MOT community. Moreover, two lightweight and plug-and-play algorithms are proposed to address two inherent "missing" problems of MOT: missing association and missing detection. Specifically, unlike most methods, which associate short tracklets into complete trajectories at high computation complexity, we propose an appearance-free link model (AFLink) to perform global association without appearance information, and achieve a good balance between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a Gaussian-smoothed interpolation (GSI) based on Gaussian process regression to relieve the missing detection. AFLink and GSI can be easily plugged into various trackers with a negligible extra computational cost (1.7 ms and 7.1 ms per image, respectively, on MOT17). Finally, by fusing StrongSORT with AFLink and GSI, the final tracker (StrongSORT++) achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple public benchmarks, i.e., MOT17, MOT20, DanceTrack and KITTI. Codes are available at https://github.com/dyhBUPT/StrongSORT and https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmtracking.},

  abstract = {Friendship and rapport play an important role in the formation of constructive social interactions, and have been widely studied in educational settings due to their impact on student outcomes. Given the growing interest in automating the analysis of such phenomena through Machine Learning (ML), access to annotated interaction datasets is highly valuable. However, no dataset on dyadic child-child interactions explicitly capturing rapport currently exists. Moreover, despite advances in the automatic analysis of human behaviour, no previous work has addressed the prediction of rapport in child-child dyadic interactions in educational settings. We present UpStory -- the Uppsala Storytelling dataset: a novel dataset of naturalistic dyadic interactions between primary school aged children, with an experimental manipulation of rapport. Pairs of children aged 8-10 participate in a task-oriented activity: designing a story together, while being allowed free movement within the play area. We promote balanced collection of different levels of rapport by using a within-subjects design: self-reported friendships are used to pair each child twice, either minimizing or maximizing pair separation in the friendship network. The dataset contains data for 35 pairs, totalling 3h 40m of audio and video recordings. It includes two video sources covering the play area, as well as separate voice recordings for each child. An anonymized version of the dataset is made publicly available, containing per-frame head pose, body pose, and face features; as well as per-pair information, including the level of rapport. Finally, we provide ML baselines for the prediction of rapport.},

Although significant progress has been made in automatic gaze estimation by deep convolutional neural networks, it is still difficult to directly deploy deep learning based gaze estimation models across different edge devices, due to the high computational cost and various resource constraints. This work proposes LiteGaze, a deep learning framework to learn architectures for efficient gaze estimation via neural architecture search (NAS). Inspired by the once-for-all model (Cai et al., 2020), this work decouples the model training and architecture search into two different stages. In particular, a supernet is trained to support diverse architectural settings. Then specialized sub-networks are selected from the obtained supernet, given different efficiency constraints. Extensive experiments are performed on two gaze estimation datasets and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over previous works, advancing the real-time gaze estimation on edge devices.},

Where the minority (positive) class holds greater value than the majority (negative) class and the occurrence of false negatives incurs a greater penalty than false positives, the bias may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing three learners, six sampling approaches, two performance metrics, and five sampled distribution ratios, to uniquely investigate the effect of severe class imbalance on Big Data analytics. The learners (               Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest               ) were implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study is based on a Medicare fraud detection dataset. The second case study, unlike the first, includes training data from one source (SlowlorisBig Dataset) and test data from a separate source (POST dataset). Results from the Medicare case study are not conclusive regarding the best sampling approach using               Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve               and               Geometric Mean               performance metrics. However, it should be noted that the               Random Undersampling               approach performs adequately in the first case study. For the SlowlorisBig case study, Random Undersampling convincingly outperforms the other five sampling approaches (               Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, SMOTE-borderline1 , SMOTE-borderline2 , ADAptive SYNthetic               ) when measuring performance with               Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve               and               Geometric Mean               metrics. Based on its classification performance in both case studies,               Random Undersampling               is the best choice as it results in models with a significantly smaller number of samples, thus reducing computational burden and training time.},

Understanding this diversity and dynamics, as well as their emerging patterns, is of great interest from social, health, and educational perspectives. The development of new devices has been made possible in recent years by advances in applied technology. This paper presents the design and development of a novel device composed of several sensors. Specifically, we propose a proximity sensor integrated by three devices: a Bluetooth sensor, a global positioning system (GPS) unit and an accelerometer. By means of this sensor it is possible to detect the presence of neighboring sensors in various configurations and operating conditions. Profiles based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) exhibit behavior consistent with that reported by empirical relationships. The present sensor is functional in detecting the proximity of other sensors and is thus useful for the identification of interactions between people in relevant contexts such as schools.},

What accounts for our capacity to understand the way the physical world works, to think ourselves into the minds of others, to gossip, read, tell stories about the past, and imagine the future? These questions are not new: they have been debated by philosophers, psychologists, anthropologists, evolutionists, and neurobiologists over the course of centuries. One explanation widely accepted today is that humans have special cognitive instincts. Unlike other living animal species, we are born with complicated mechanisms for reasoning about causation, reading the minds of others, copying behaviors, and using language. Cecilia Heyes agrees that adult humans have impressive pieces of cognitive equipment. In her framing, however, these cognitive gadgets are not instincts programmed in the genes but are constructed in the course of childhood through social interaction. Cognitive gadgets are products of cultural evolution, rather than genetic evolution. At birth, the minds of human babies are only subtly different from the minds of newborn chimpanzees. We are friendlier, our attention is drawn to different things, and we have a capacity to learn and remember that outstrips the abilities of newborn chimpanzees. Yet when these subtle differences are exposed to culture-soaked human environments, they have enormous effects. They enable us to upload distinctively human ways of thinking from the social world around us. As Cognitive Gadgets makes clear, from birth our malleable human minds can learn through culture not only what to think but how to think it},

In this context, children use movement as a social tool, resulting in distinctive proximity patterns in space and synchrony with others over time. However, the social implications of children's movements with peers in space and time are difficult to determine due to the difficulty of acquiring reliable data during natural interactions. In this article, we review research demonstrating that proximity and synchrony are important indicators of affiliation among preschoolers and highlight challenges in this line of research. We then argue for the advantages of using wearable sensor technology and machine learning analytics to quantify social movement. This technological and analytical advancement provides an unprecedented view of complex social interactions among preschoolers in natural settings, and can help integrate young children's movements with others in space and time into a coherent interaction framework.},

So far, most information about the frequency and duration of spending time together is based on self-report questionnaires. Although recent technological innovations have stimulated the development of objective approaches for measuring physical proximity in humans in everyday life, these methods still have substantial limitations. Here we present a novel method, using Bluetooth low-energy beacons and a smartphone application, to measure the frequency and duration of dyads being in close proximity in daily life. This method can also be used to link the frequency and duration of proximity to the quality of interactions, by using proximity-triggered questionnaires. We examined the use of this novel method by exploring proximity patterns of family interactions among 233 participants (77 Dutch families, with 77 adolescents [               M               age               = 15.9] and 145 parents [               M               age               = 48.9]) for 14 consecutive days. Overall, proximity-based analyses indicated that adolescents were more often and longer in proximity to mothers than to fathers, with large differences between families in frequency and duration. Proximity-triggered evaluations of the interactions and parenting behavior were generally positive for both fathers and mothers. This innovative method is a promising tool that can be broadly used in other social contexts to yield new and more detailed insights into social proximity in daily life.},

To this end, we gathered diverse child-centered corpora which sums up to a total of 260 hours of recordings and covers 10 languages.

  abstract = {One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense classification and localization. The classification is usually optimized by Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta distribution. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the predicted quality facilitates the classification to improve detection performance. This paper delves into the representations of the above three fundamental elements: quality estimation, classification and localization. Two problems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) the inconsistent usage of the quality estimation and classification between training and inference and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization when there is ambiguity and uncertainty in complex scenes. To address the problems, we design new representations for these elements. Specifically, we merge the quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint representation of localization quality and classification, and use a vector to represent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations eliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible distribution in real data, but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the scope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the continuous version for successful optimization. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0\textbackslash\% AP using ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5\textbackslash\%) and ATSS (43.6\textbackslash\%) with higher or comparable inference speed, under the same backbone and training settings. Notably, our best model can achieve a single-model single-scale AP of 48.2\textbackslash\%, at 10 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU. Code and models are available at https://github.com/implus/GFocal.},

  abstract = {Temporal action proposal generation is an challenging and promising task which aims to locate temporal regions in real-world videos where action or event may occur. Current bottom-up proposal generation methods can generate proposals with precise boundary, but cannot efficiently generate adequately reliable confidence scores for retrieving proposals. To address these difficulties, we introduce the Boundary-Matching (BM) mechanism to evaluate confidence scores of densely distributed proposals, which denote a proposal as a matching pair of starting and ending boundaries and combine all densely distributed BM pairs into the BM confidence map. Based on BM mechanism, we propose an effective, efficient and end-to-end proposal generation method, named Boundary-Matching Network (BMN), which generates proposals with precise temporal boundaries as well as reliable confidence scores simultaneously. The two-branches of BMN are jointly trained in an unified framework. We conduct experiments on two challenging datasets: THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3, where BMN shows significant performance improvement with remarkable efficiency and generalizability. Further, combining with existing action classifier, BMN can achieve state-of-the-art temporal action detection performance.},

  abstract = {Human children far exceed modern machine learning algorithms in their sample efficiency, achieving high performance in key domains with much less data than current models. This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience -- their ''training data'' -- is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of the largest developmental egocentric video dataset to date -- the BabyView dataset -- recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 493 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months - 5 years of age in both longitudinal, at-home contexts and in a preschool environment. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain. Our dataset stands as an open challenge for robust, humanlike AI systems: how can such systems achieve human-levels of success on the same scale and distribution of training data as humans?},

It provides 300 hours of daily activities from 264 participants across 50 locations, total travelling distance over 399Km. The language descriptions contain 301.5K sentences in 8.64M words from a vocabulary size of 6545.

  abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

  abstract = {The Interaction Engine Hypothesis postulates that humans have a unique ability and motivation for social interaction. A crucial juncture in the ontogeny of the interaction engine could be around 2–4 years of age, but observational studies of children in natural contexts are limited. These data appear critical also for comparison with non-human primates. Here, we report on focal observations on 31 children aged 2- and 4-years old in four preschools (10 h per child). Children interact with a wide range of partners, many infrequently, but with one or two close friends. Four-year olds engage in cooperative social interactions more often than 2-year olds and fight less than 2-year olds. Conversations and playing with objects are the most frequent social interaction types in both age groups. Children engage in social interactions with peers frequently (on average 13 distinct social interactions per hour) and briefly (28 s on average) and shorter than those of great apes in comparable studies. Their social interactions feature entry and exit phases about two-thirds of the time, less frequently than great apes. The results support the Interaction Engine Hypothesis, as young children manifest a remarkable motivation and ability for fast-paced interactions with multiple partners.

We found that children from high-SES families frequently used gesture to communicate at 14 months, a relation that was explained by parent gesture use (with speech controlled). In turn, the fact that children from high-SES families have large vocabularies at 54 months was explained by children's gesture use at 14 months. Thus, differences in early gesture help to explain the disparities in vocabulary that children bring with them to school.},

Laboratory studies have identified many individual factors that contribute to word learning, and larger scale studies show correlations between aspects of the home environment and language outcomes. To date, no study has compared across many factors involved in word learning. We introduce a new ultradense set of recordings that capture a single child’s daily experience during the emergence of language. We show that words used in distinctive spatial, temporal, and linguistic contexts are produced earlier, suggesting they are easier to learn. These findings support the importance of multimodal context in word learning for one child and provide new methods for quantifying the quality of children’s language input.           ,              Children learn words through an accumulation of interactions grounded in context. Although many factors in the learning environment have been shown to contribute to word learning in individual studies, no empirical synthesis connects across factors. We introduce a new ultradense corpus of audio and video recordings of a single child’s life that allows us to measure the child’s experience of each word in his vocabulary. This corpus provides the first direct comparison, to our knowledge, between different predictors of the child’s production of individual words. We develop a series of new measures of the distinctiveness of the spatial, temporal, and linguistic contexts in which a word appears, and show that these measures are stronger predictors of learning than frequency of use and that, unlike frequency, they play a consistent role across different syntactic categories. Our findings provide a concrete instantiation of classic ideas about the role of coherent activities in word learning and demonstrate the value of multimodal data in understanding children’s language acquisition.},

  abstract = {Abstract                                           There are two broad views of children's theory of mind. The mentalist view is that it emerges in infancy and is possibly innate. The minimalist view is that it emerges more gradually in childhood and is heavily dependent on learning. According to minimalism, children initially understand behaviors rather than mental states, and they are assisted in doing so by recognizing repeating patterns in behavior. The regularities in behavior allow them to predict future behaviors, succeed on theory‐of‐mind tasks, acquire mental state words, and eventually, understand the mental states underlying behavior. The present study provided the first clear evidence for the plausibility of this view by fitting head cameras to 54 infants aged 6 to 25 months, and recording their view of the world in their daily lives. At 6 and 12 months, infants viewed an average of 146.5 repeated behaviors per hour, a rate consistent with approximately 560,000 repetitions in their first year, and with repetitions correlating with children's acquisition of mental state words, even after controlling for their general vocabulary and a range of variables indexing social interaction. We also recorded infants’ view of people searching or searching for and retrieving objects. These were 92 times less common and did not correlate with mental state vocabulary. Overall, the findings indicate that repeated behaviors provide a rich source of information for children that would readily allow them to recognize patterns in behavior and help them acquire mental state words, providing the first clear evidence for this claim of minimalism.                                         Research Highlights                                                                        Six‐ to 25‐month‐olds wore head cameras to record home life from infants’ point‐of‐view and help adjudicate between nativist and minimalist views of theory‐of‐mind (ToM).                                                           Nativists say ToM is too early developing to enable learning, whereas minimalists say infants learn to predict behaviors from behavior patterns in environment.                                                           Consistent with minimalism, infants had an incredibly rich exposure (146.5/h, {$>$}560,000 in first year) to repeated behaviors (e.g., drinking from a cup repeatedly).

Is this change in the properties of the visual inputs beneficial or even critical for the proper development of the visual system? To address this question, we used video recordings from infants wearing head-mounted cameras to train a variety of self-supervised learning models. Critically, we separated the infant data by age group and evaluated the importance of training with a curriculum aligned with developmental order. We found that initiating learning with the data from the youngest age group provided the strongest learning signal and led to the best learning outcomes in terms of downstream task performance. We then showed that the benefits of the data from the youngest age group are due to the slowness and simplicity of the visual experience. The results provide strong empirical evidence for the importance of the properties of the early infant experience and developmental progression in training. More broadly, our approach and findings take a noteworthy step towards reverse engineering the learning mechanisms in newborn brains using image-computable models from artificial intelligence.}

  abstract = {We investigate architectures of discriminatively trained deep Convolutional Networks (ConvNets) for action recognition in video. The challenge is to capture the complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion between frames. We also aim to generalise the best performing hand-crafted features within a data-driven learning framework. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architecture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate that a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical flow is able to achieve very good performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multi-task learning, applied to two different action classification datasets, can be used to increase the amount of training data and improve the performance on both. Our architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions benchmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it is competitive with the state of the art. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video classification.},

  abstract = {Human infants have the remarkable ability to learn the associations between object names and visual objects from inherently ambiguous experiences. Researchers in cognitive science and developmental psychology have built formal models that implement in-principle learning algorithms, and then used pre-selected and pre-cleaned datasets to test the abilities of the models to find statistical regularities in the input data. In contrast to previous modeling approaches, the present study used egocentric video and gaze data collected from infant learners during natural toy play with their parents. This allowed us to capture the learning environment from the perspective of the learner's own point of view. We then used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to process sensory data from the infant's point of view and learn name-object associations from scratch. As the first model that takes raw egocentric video to simulate infant word learning, the present study provides a proof of principle that the problem of early word learning can be solved, using actual visual data perceived by infant learners. Moreover, we conducted simulation experiments to systematically determine how visual, perceptual, and attentional properties of infants' sensory experiences may affect word learning.},

  abstract = {Fast person re-identification (ReID) aims to search person images quickly and accurately. The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm, which learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and counting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g. 2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new solution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code search strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving both faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank broad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top candidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an All-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization (DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of different lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid structure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by self-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple optimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily controlled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a \$F\_β\$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution functions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method (CtF) is not only 8\% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing ReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is \$50\textbackslash times\$ faster with comparable accuracy. Code is available at https://github.com/wangguanan/light-reid.},

  abstract = {Deep convolutional networks have achieved great success for image recognition. However, for action recognition in videos, their advantage over traditional methods is not so evident. We present a general and flexible video-level framework for learning action models in videos. This method, called temporal segment network (TSN), aims to model long-range temporal structures with a new segment-based sampling and aggregation module. This unique design enables our TSN to efficiently learn action models by using the whole action videos. The learned models could be easily adapted for action recognition in both trimmed and untrimmed videos with simple average pooling and multi-scale temporal window integration, respectively. We also study a series of good practices for the instantiation of TSN framework given limited training samples. Our approach obtains the state-the-of-art performance on four challenging action recognition benchmarks: HMDB51 (71.0\%), UCF101 (94.9\%), THUMOS14 (80.1\%), and ActivityNet v1.2 (89.6\%). Using the proposed RGB difference for motion models, our method can still achieve competitive accuracy on UCF101 (91.0\%) while running at 340 FPS. Furthermore, based on the temporal segment networks, we won the video classification track at the ActivityNet challenge 2016 among 24 teams, which demonstrates the effectiveness of TSN and the proposed good practices.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of wearable cameras, a massive collection of egocentric video for first-person visual perception becomes available. Using egocentric videos to predict first-person activity faces many challenges, including limited field of view, occlusions, and unstable motions. Observing that sensor data from wearable devices facilitates human activity recognition, multi-modal activity recognition is attracting increasing attention. However, the deficiency of related dataset hinders the development of multi-modal deep learning for egocentric activity recognition. Nowadays, deep learning in real world has led to a focus on continual learning that often suffers from catastrophic forgetting. But the catastrophic forgetting problem for egocentric activity recognition, especially in the context of multiple modalities, remains unexplored due to unavailability of dataset. In order to assist this research, we present a multi-modal egocentric activity dataset for continual learning named UESTC-MMEA-CL, which is collected by self-developed glasses integrating a first-person camera and wearable sensors. It contains synchronized data of videos, accelerometers, and gyroscopes, for 32 types of daily activities, performed by 10 participants. Its class types and scale are compared with other publicly available datasets. The statistical analysis of the sensor data is given to show the auxiliary effects for different behaviors. And results of egocentric activity recognition are reported when using separately, and jointly, three modalities: RGB, acceleration, and gyroscope, on a base network architecture. To explore the catastrophic forgetting in continual learning tasks, four baseline methods are extensively evaluated with different multi-modal combinations. We hope the UESTC-MMEA-CL can promote future studies on continual learning for first-person activity recognition in wearable applications.},

Experiment 2 demonstrates the use of this method in the naturalistic context of toy play with a parent.

In particular, our framework adopts a cascaded structure with three stages of carefully designed deep convolutional networks that predict face and landmark location in a coarse-to-fine manner. In addition, in the learning process, we propose a new online hard sample mining strategy that can improve the performance automatically without manual sample selection.
